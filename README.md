# Pipe-Simulator
An electron compiled pipe simulator for Mario Kart Tour! Updated simultaneously (and automatically) with my Mario Kart Tour Values tool. 

Ironically, this has taken far too much time.

**Update 1.1**
- 2 new Pipes included
- Skip star animation in settings, which was previously unskippable in the middle of pulling
- Skip results scene on singles in settings, it's more accurate to the game that way.
- Some updates to the details section
- ACP can never be a Green Fakeout
- Instead of using APNG/GIF, all pulling now uses videos which are the source quality and are much better.
- There is now shop music! This can be disabled in settings.
- Show and hide official pipes, it's easier that way sometimes
- Many sounds that did not loop now do
- The pulling pipe glow is now more accurate, though it is still not perfect.
- Settings now save and are loaded when opening the app
- More sound effects within the app

**Future changes:**
-Rework spotlight odds. That new system with 2 of the same spotlight messed it up.
-Adjust settings and rubies count to be fixed to the top of the screen
-Remove unused assets
-Custom pipes creation?????
