# Pipe-Simulator
An electron compiled pipe simulator for Mario Kart Tour! Updated simultaneously (and automatically) with my Mario Kart Tour Values tool. 

Ironically, this has taken far too much time. Especially now.

- Voice clips! Your favorite drivers now have their voice clips when pulling.
- The News section! Now you can keep up with what is added to the simulator
